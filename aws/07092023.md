# EKS Blueprints for Terraform
Source: https://catalog.workshops.aws/eks-blueprints-terraform/en-US

## Objectives
- build a multi-team platform on top of EKS
- deploy workloads freely without the platform team being the bottleneck
- the baseline setup of an EKS cluster
- gradually add add-ons to easily enhance its capabilities, such as enabling ArgoCD, Rollouts, GitOps and other common open-source add-ons

## Introduction
- What is EKS Blueprints? **what**
- What are the components and tools to build EKS blueprint? **components and tools**
- What are the benefits? **benefits**
- How do different personas, leverage EKS Blueprints? **leverage for differ teams**
- What is a reference architecture diagram? **architecture references**
- How is compute infrastructure defined, and how do you provision and manage it across environments using EKS Blueprints? **provisioning**
- How are teams onboarded to the EKS Blueprints, and control to access shared EKS clusters? **join and control access**
- How about the workloads in multiple environments? **mutliple env**

### What is EKS Blueprints?

- The EKS Blueprints is an **open-source development framework** that abstracts the complexities of cloud infrastructure from developers and allows them to deploy workloads with ease
- Containerized environments on AWS are composed of **multiple AWS or open source products and services**, including services for running containers, CI/CD pipelines, capturing logs/metrics, and security enforcements. 
- The EKS Blueprints framework **packages these tools into a cohesive whole and makes them available to development teams as a service**. 
- From an operational perspective, the framework **allows companies to consolidate tools and best practices** for securing, scaling, monitoring, and operating containerized infrastructure into a central platform that can then be used by developers across an enterprise.

### How is the EKS Blueprints built?
- The EKS Blueprints is built **on top of Amazon EKS and all the various components** that we need to efficiently address Day 2 operations. A blueprint is defined via **Infrastructre-as-Code** best practices through AWS CDK or Hashicorp Terraform, through two open-source projects:
- The EKS Blueprints for Terraform 
- The EKS Blueprints for CDK 

### What can I do with a Blueprint?

- For customers:
  - Deploy EKS clusters across any number of accounts and regions
  - Manage cluster configuration (add-ons that run in each cluster, from a single Git repository)
  - Define teams, namespaces, and their associated access permissions for your clusters.
  - Leverage GitOps-based workflows for onboarding and managing workloads for your teams.

- There is also a EKS Blueprints Patterns examples directory [here](https://github.com/aws-ia/terraform-aws-eks-blueprints/tree/main/examples)
  - analytics clusters with Spark or EMR on EKS
  - fully private eks clusters
  - IPV6 eks clusters
  - EKS clusters scaling with Karpenter
  - Clusters with observability tools
    and much more...

### Benefits of EKS Blueprints
- Why leverage the EKS Blueprints?
  - The challenge of how to integrate the workloads build from Kubernetes and the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), including build, provision, and manage configuration. 
  - To provide customers with a tool chain that can help them deploy a platform on top of EKS with ease and best practices. 
  - EKS Blueprints provide logical abstractions and prescriptive guidance for building a platform. 
- Separation of Concerns: Platform Teams vs Application Teams
  - Platform teams build the tools that provision, manage, and secure the underlying infrastructure
  - Application teams are free to focus on building the applications that deliver business value to customers. 
  - Application teams need to focus on writing code and quickly shipping products
  - There must be certain standards that are uniform across all production applications to make them secure, compliant, and highly available.
- EKS Blueprints provides:
  - Better workflow between platform and application teams
  - a self-service interface for developers to use that is streamlined for developing code. 
  - The platform teams have full control to define standards on security, software delivery, monitoring, and networking (make more secure, compliant, and highly available.)
  - The developers donâ€™t have to configure and manage the underlying cloud resources themselves. 

### Solution provided by EKS Blueprints
- Provisioning infrastructure on demand and deploy in minutes
- Software delivery is automated via continuous delivery pipelines
- Security best practices are baked in to every application and service
- Applications are fully instrumented for metric and log collection
- Organizations standardize on tools and best practices

- The core principles of EKS Blueprints:
  - Security and Compliance
  - Cost Management
  - Deployment Automation
  - Provisioning of infrastructure
  - Telemetry

### How does it affect different individuals?
- Platform team
  - Using this [repo](https://github.com/aws-ia/terraform-aws-eks-blueprints), written in Terraform HCL language.
  - Build a shared platform where multiple teams can consume and deploy their workloads. 
  - The EKS underlying technology is Kubernetes
- Application team
  - Once the EKS cluster has been provisioned, a Application Team (Riker Team) will deploy a workload (basic static web app that will be deployed using GitOps continuous delivery).

### Getting Started
- Starting AWS Cloud9 IDE
  - AWS Cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE)
  - It lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. 
  - It includes a code editor, debugger, and terminal. 
  - Cloud9 comes pre-packaged with essential tools for popular programming languages and the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) pre-installed 

### Provision Amazon EKS Cluster
