## Create Your First Amazon EC2 Instance (Linux)
Link: https://cloudacademy.com/lab/create-your-first-amazon-ec2-instance/


1. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is one of the most popular AWS services. 
2. EC2 allows you to launch different types of cloud instances and pay for them with a pay-per-use model. 
3. Menu's in EC2 
  - Additional navigation options are across the top-left of the Dashboard
  - Basic account information, current region, and Support options are across the top-right
  - Navigation to additional EC2 resources and features are located in the left pane
  - Resources section - provides a high-level summary of current EC2 resource usage
  - Launch Instance section - Offers a single click to start the process of launching a new EC2 instance (you'll do that next)
  - Service Health section - Simple and quick way to obtain the high-level service health in current region
  - Additional Information - Context sensitive help on Getting Started (with EC2) or a complete listing of all AWS documentation

4. Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for securing data communication. It establishes a secure channel over an insecure network. Common applications include remote command-line login and remote command execution.

5. How to check the EC2 instance metadata, which is only available from within the instance itself. 

6. Instance metadata is data about your instance that you can use to configure or manage the running instance. In order to obtain the instance metadata you will use the curl utility. cURL (Client URL) is a free, open-source project, and already loaded on your instance, supported protocol such as HTTP. 

7. Note: The IP address used below (169.254.169.254) is a special use address to return metadata information tied to EC2 instances. The following steps use the Instance Metadata Service Version 1 (IMDSv1) method to access the instance metadata. By default, both IMDSv1 and IMDSv2 can be used on most AMIs. For more information regarding these methods, please reference the following AWS documentation. 

```bash
curl -w "\n" http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
```

8. AWS bills EC2 usage per second in most cases. The specific instance and the data on the root volume (system disk) is not recoverable (by default) however. So be sure you don't need it before terminating an instance. If you stop an instance, you can start it again later (and access data on all the disks). In this lab step, you will terminate a running EC2 instance.


## Introduction to Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
Link: https://cloudacademy.com/lab/introduction-virtual-private-cloud-vpc/


1. Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) lets you provision a logically isolated section of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. 

2. You have complete control over your virtual networking environment, including the selection of your own IP address range, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways. 

3. Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that you've defined. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS. It is logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS cloud.

4. Amazon creates the requested VPC and the following linked services:
  - a DHCP options set  (this set enables DNS for instances that need to communicate over the VPC's Internet gateway) 
  - a Route Table  (it contains a set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic is directed) 
  - a Network ACL  (it is a list of rules to determine whether traffic is allowed in or out of any subnet associated with the network ACL)

A VPC subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC. You can add one or more subnets in each Availability Zone, but each subnet must reside entirely within one Availability Zone and cannot span zones. Availability Zones are distinct locations that are engineered to be isolated from failures in other Availability Zones. By launching instances in separate Availability Zones, you can protect your applications from the failure of a single location.

5. An internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between instances in your VPC and the Internet. It imposes no availability risks or bandwidth constraints on your network traffic. 

6. An internet gateway serves two purposes: to provide a target in your VPC route tables for internet-routable traffic and to perform network address translation (NAT) for instances that have been assigned public IP addresses.

7. To use an internet gateway your subnet's route table must contain a route that directs internet-bound traffic to the internet gateway. You can scope the route to all destinations not explicitly known to the route table (0.0.0.0/0), or you can scope the route to a narrower range of IP addresses; for example, the public IP addresses of your companyâ€™s public endpoints outside of AWS, or the Elastic IP addresses of other Amazon EC2 instances outside your VPC. If your subnet is associated with a route table that has a route to an internet gateway, it's known as a public subnet.

8. An Elastic IP address (EIP) is a static and public IP address that you can associate with an EC2 instance. EIPs have the benefit of not changing when you stop and start an EC2 instance, whereas the default public IP that comes with an EC2 instance may change. This gives you the benefit of a reliable IP address to associate with your EC2 instance. In this Lab Step you will allocate an EIP and associate it with your EC2 instance.



## Introduction to DynamoDB
Link: https://cloudacademy.com/lab/introduction-dynamodb/

1. Amazon DynamoDB is a NoSQL Database in the cloud, suitable for anyone needing a reliable and fully managed NoSQL solution. DynamoDB is designed to provide automated storage scaling and low latency. It is particularly useful when your application must read and store massive amounts of data and you need speed and reliability (Amazon works with replicas of your database in three different Availability Zones). Amazon DynamoDB is totally managed. You simply select an AWS region, define the needed indexes for each table you will create, and Amazon takes care of everything else.

2. PartiQL is a SQL (Structured Query Language) compatible language for Amazon DynamoDB. As well as querying tables, you can use it to insert new items and update existing ones.

3. PartiQL supports most standard features of SQL which means you can query, select, and sort your data in sophisticated ways.

4. Typically, using the Amazon DynamoDB Console to query items is useful for one-off reports and debugging or troubleshooting. Like most databases, DynamoDB can be accessed programmatically by other systems and software applications through either the AWS SDK (software development kit) or DyanmoDB's HTTP API (application programming interface).

## Configuring a Static Website With S3 And CloudFront
Link: https://cloudacademy.com/lab/configuring-static-website-s3-and-cloudfront/


1. You can easily and inexpensively use Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host a website that uses client-side technologies (such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and does not require server-side technologies (such as PHP and ASP.NET). This type of site is called a static website and is used to display content that does not change frequently.

2. Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service from AWS. It's well-known for its scalability, availability, security features, and performance. Object storage is a ubiquitous need and Amazon S3 is often a part of any non-trivial solution built in AWS.

3. You have added a unique number to the bucket name because Amazon S3 bucket names must be unique regardless of the AWS region in which the bucket is created.

4. A bucket name must also be DNS compliant. Here are some of the rules it must adhere to:
  - They must be at least 3 and no more than 63 characters long.
  - They may contain lowercase letters, numbers, periods, and/or hyphens.
  - Each label must start and end with a lowercase letter or a number.
  - They cannot be formatted as an IP address (for example, 192.168.1.1).

5. The Properties tab allows you to enable and disable various Amazon S3 bucket features, including:
  - Bucket Versioning: Old versions can be kept when objects are updated
  - Default encryption: A bucket can be configured to encrypt all objects by default
  - Server access logging: Web-server style access logs can be enabled
  Requester pays: When enabled, the entity downloading data from this bucket will pay data transfer costs incurred

6. Bucket policy to s3
```bash
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AddPerm",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

7. Amazon CloudFront is a global Content Delivery Network (CDN) that delivers data securely and efficiently. CloudFront pulls your website out to the edge of the network, reducing latency when accessed from different global locations.


## Introduction to the Elastic File System
Link: https://cloudacademy.com/lab/introduction-elastic-file-system/


1. Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides simple, scalable file storage for use with Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS Cloud. With Amazon EFS, storage capacity is elastic, growing and shrinking automatically as you add and remove files - so your applications have the storage they need, when they need it.

2. Amazon EFS has a simple web services interface that allows you to create and configure file systems quickly and easily. The service manages all the file storage infrastructure for you, avoiding the complexity of deploying, patching, and maintaining complex file system deployments. 


## Managing Instance Volumes Using EBS
Link: https://cloudacademy.com/lab/managing-instance-volumes-using-ebs/

1. Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides persistent block-level storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS Cloud. Each Amazon EBS volume is automatically replicated within its Availability Zone to protect you from component failure. This provides high availability and durability. Amazon EBS volumes offer consistent, low-latency performance needed to run your workloads.

2. After writing data to an Amazon EBS volume, you can periodically create a snapshot of the volume to use as a baseline for new volumes or for data backup. If you make periodic snapshots of a volume, the snapshots are incremental so that only the blocks on the device that have changed after your last snapshot are saved in the new snapshot. Even though snapshots are saved incrementally, the snapshot deletion process is designed so that you need to retain only the most recent snapshot in order to restore the volume.

3. Snapshots occur asynchronously and the status of the snapshot is "pending" until the snapshot is complete.

4. You can take a snapshot of an attached volume that is in use. However, snapshots only capture data that has been written to your Amazon EBS volume at the time the snapshot command is issued. This might exclude any data that has been cached by any applications or the operating system. If you can pause any file writes to the volume long enough to take a snapshot, your snapshot should be complete. However, if you can't pause all file writes to the volume, you should unmount the volume from within the instance, issue the snapshot command, and then remount the volume to ensure a consistent and complete snapshot. You can remount and use your volume while the snapshot status is "pending".

5. To create a snapshot for Amazon EBS volumes that serve as root devices, you should stop the instance before taking the snapshot.


## Working with Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling Groups and Network Load Balancer
Link: https://cloudacademy.com/lab/working-amazon-ec2-auto-scaling-groups/


1. The Amazon Web Services (AWS) Auto Scaling service automatically adds or removes compute resources allocated for your cloud application, in response to changes in demand. For applications configured to run on a cloud infrastructure, scaling is an important part of cost control and resource management.

2. Scaling is the ability to increase or decrease the compute capacity of your application either by changing the number of servers (horizontal scaling) or by changing the size of the servers (vertical scaling).

3. Auto Scaling helps you maintain application availability and allows you to scale your Amazon EC2 capacity up or down automatically according to the defined conditions. You can use Auto Scaling to help ensure that you are running your desired number of Amazon EC2 instances. Auto Scaling can also automatically increase the number of Amazon EC2 instances during demand spikes to maintain performance and decrease capacity during lulls to reduce costs. Auto Scaling is well suited to applications that have stable demand patterns, or that experience hourly, daily, or weekly variability in usage.

4. Groups: Your EC2 instances are organized into groups so that they can be treated as a logical unit for the purposes of scaling and management. When you create a group, you can specify its minimum, maximum, and desired number of EC2 instances. 

5. Launch configurations: Your group uses a launch configuration as a template for its EC2 instances. When you create a launch configuration, you can specify information such as the AMI ID, instance type, key pair, security groups, and block device mapping for your instances. 

6. Launch template: A launch template is similar to a launch configuration, in that it specifies instance configuration information. ... However, defining a launch template instead of a launch configuration allows you to have multiple versions of a template. With versioning, you can create a subset of the full set of parameters and then reuse it to create other templates or template versions.


7. Auto Scaling groups are commonly paired with load balancers that evenly distribute requests across all the instances in the group. In this Lab, you will create a load balancer before creating an Auto Scaling group so that the Auto Scaling group can be configured to work with the load balancer at creation time.

8. Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple Amazon EC2 instances. They enable you to achieve greater fault tolerance in your applications and seamlessly provide the correct amount of load balancing capacity needed in response to incoming application requests.

9. ELB detects unhealthy instances within a pool and automatically reroutes traffic to healthy instances until the unhealthy instances have been restored. Elastic Load Balancers can be enabled within a single Availability Zone or across multiple zones for greater consistent application performance.

There are several ELB load balancers to choose from. The network load balancer is a network layer (layer-4) load balancer operating on TCP connections and UDP. It can scale to millions of requests per second and is a more modern alternative to the classic load balancer (also a layer-7 load balancer). With a network load balancer, backend targets are organized into target groups which the network load balancer distributes traffic across. You will create a network load balancer in this lab step.

10. You must enable Cross-zone load balancing to achieve the highest level of availability. Without enabling this feature, clients could cache the DNS address of the load balancer node in one availability zone and that node would only distribute requests to instances within the availability zone. Cross-Zone Load Balancing allows every load balancer node to distribute requests across all availability zones, although for the Network Load Balancer there are data transfer charges when this feature is enabled. (There are no data charges for other types of load balancers)

11. A Launch Template is a template that an Auto Scaling group uses to launch Amazon EC2 instances. If you've launched an individual EC2 instance before, you've already walked through the process of defining compute characteristics such as the instance type, security groups, and configuration scripts. A launch template allows you to define these same characteristics, which are then applied to any instances launched in the Auto Scaling group that references the Launch Template. The Launch Template essentially contains the blueprint or DNA for the exact type of instance that should be launched. Hence, when auto-scaling, each instance is guaranteed to be just like the last one. It's repeatable, scalable, and reliable.

12. When you create the Launch Template you will include information such as the Amazon machine image ID (AMI) to use for launching the EC2 instance, the instance type, key pairs, security groups, and block device mappings, among other configuration settings. When you create your Auto Scaling group, you must associate it with a Launch Template.

13. An Auto Scaling group is a representation of multiple Amazon EC2 instances that share similar characteristics and that are treated as a logical grouping for the purposes of instance scaling and management. For example, if a single application operates across multiple instances, you might want to increase or decrease the number of instances in that group to improve the performance of the application. You can use the Auto Scaling group to automatically scale the number of instances or maintain a fixed number of instances. You create Auto Scaling groups by defining the minimum, maximum, and the desired number of running EC2 instances the group must have at any given point of time.

14. An Auto Scaling group starts by launching the minimum number (or the desired number, if specified) of EC2 instances and then increases or decreases the number of running EC2 instances automatically according to the conditions that you define. Auto Scaling also maintains the current instance levels by conducting periodic health checks on all the instances within the Auto Scaling group. If an EC2 instance within the Auto Scaling group becomes unhealthy, Auto Scaling terminates the unhealthy instance and launches a new one to replace the unhealthy instance. This automatic scaling and maintenance of the instance in an Auto Scaling group is the core value of the Auto Scaling service. It's what puts the "elastic" in EC2. 
 

15. Auto-scaling groups allow you to scale out (add more instances) or scale in (remove instances) based on metrics such as:
  - Average CPU utilization
  - Network traffic (ingress and egress)
  - Application Load Balancer request counts

16. It's possible to create your own metrics and use these to decide when to scale, such metrics can be populated in CloudWatch directly from the application rather than inspecting the instance's resource usage. This is useful when the point that you need to scale at is determined by something unrelated to the instance, such as reaching a database connection limit or some other application-specific bottleneck.

17. By default, the Metric type is Average CPU utilization, and the Target value is 50 percent. Leave these values unchanged.


18. Performing end-to-end tests to make sure everything is working as you think it should is very important. Although this may be an automated procedure, often a quick sanity test by other individuals and/or groups directly from the AWS Console is also helpful. This lab step will point out a few ways to test that your Launch Configuration is working in conjunction with the Auto Scaling group and CloudWatch Alarm (which uses AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS)).

```bash
stress --cpu 2 --io 1 --vm 1 --vm-bytes 128M --timeout 5m
```

## Create Your First Amazon RDS Database
Link: https://cloudacademy.com/lab/create-your-first-amazon-rds-database/


1. Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. You can migrate existing applications and tools that utilize a relational database to Amazon Web Services because Amazon RDS offers access to the capabilities of a MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and the PostgreSQL database engine. Amazon RDS provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while managing time-consuming database administration tasks. This efficiency frees you to focus on your applications and business.

2. Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. Before launching actual RDS instances, you need to configure a DB Subnet Group.

3. Subnets are segments of a VPC's IP address range that allow you to group your resources based on security and operational needs. A DB Subnet Group is a collection of subnets (typically private) that you create in a VPC and designate for your DB instances. Each DB subnet group should have subnets in at least two Availability Zones in a given region. Note that SQL Server Mirroring with a SQL Server DB instance requires at least 3 subnets in distinct Availability Zones.

4. When creating a DB instance in a VPC, you must select a DB subnet group. Amazon RDS uses that DB subnet group and your preferred Availability Zone to select a subnet and an IP address within that subnet to associate with your DB instance. When Amazon RDS creates a DB instance in a VPC, it assigns a network interface to your DB instance by using an IP address selected from your DB Subnet Group. If the primary DB instance of a Multi-AZ deployment fails, Amazon RDS can promote the corresponding standby and subsequently create a new standby using an IP address from an assigned subnet in one of the other Availability Zones.

5. The rules of a Security Group control the inbound traffic that's allowed to reach the instances that are associated with the security group and the outbound traffic that's allowed to leave them. By default, security groups allow all outbound traffic and deny all inbound traffic.


6. Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. Amazon RDS is designed for developers or businesses who require the full features and capabilities of a relational database or who wish to migrate existing applications and tools that utilize a relational database. It gives you access to the capabilities of a MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, MariaDB, Amazon Aurora, or PostgreSQL database engine.

7. The RDS service is fully managed by Amazon. RDS will make sure that the database software stays up-to-date with the latest patches and any faulty compute instance powering your database deployment will be automatically replaced in the event of a hardware failure. You can automatically or manually create database snapshots and easily scale your infrastructure up or down using the AWS Management Console.

8. For production workloads, you can consider using provisioned IOPS as the Storage type to guarantee consistent throughput levels. Storage autoscaling can also be useful in production to avoid manually scaling up the database's storage when it breaches a certain threshold. Neither is needed for this lab. 

9. Session Manager is part of AWS Systems Manager suite of tools for gaining operational insights and taking action on AWS resources. Session Manager gives you browser-based shell access to EC2 instances running the Systems Manager agent. Both Windows and Linux instances are supported. Session manager provides secure access to instances without the need to distribute passwords or SSH keys. Session Manager also allows you to connect to instances without having to open any inbound ports. All communication is encrypted and IAM policies can restrict access to sessions running in Session Manager.
