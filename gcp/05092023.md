# Google Cloud Migrations
Source: https://cloud.google.com/architecture/migrations

## Migrate to Google Cloud: Choose your migration path
- Scenarios:
  - From an on premises env
  - From a private hosting env
  - From another cloud provider to Google Cloud
- Path:
  - framework to design and run your migration journey 
  - Use the framework as a baseline against which we can use to assess the migration progress
  - Give guidance that's specific to a particular environment 

## Benefits of establishing a migration framework
- Migration can be a repeatable task
- Phases during migration
  - Assess and discover your workloads
  - Plan and build a foundation.
  - Deploy your workloads.
  - Optimize your environment and workloads.
- Moving from one environment to another is a **challenging task**, so you need to plan and execute your migration carefully. We need to complete tasks such :
  - Creating an inventory
  - Establishing user and service identities
  - Deploying your workloads
  - Otimizing for performance and scalability
- Some scenarios within the documents
  - Migrate VMs with Migrate to VMs
  - Migrate containers to Google Cloud
  - Migrate VMs to containers with Migrate to Containers

## Migrate to Google Cloud: Get started
- We start by defining the environments that are involved in the migration
- An on-prem env: an env where we have full ownership and responsibility. We retain full control over every aspect of the environment, such as cooling, physical security, and hardware maintenance
- Private hosting env such as a colocation
  - We outsource part of the physical infrastructure and its management to an external party
  - This infrastructure is typically shared between customers. 
  - We don't have to manage the physical security and safety services. 
  - Some hosting envs let us manage part of the physical hardware, such as servers, racks, and network devices, while others manage that hardware for you
  - Typically, power and network cabling are provided as a service so we don't have to manage them. 
  - You maintain full control over hypervisors that virtualize physical resources, the virtualized infrastructure that you provision, and workloads that you run on that infrastructure.
- A public cloud env: we don't have to manage the whole resource stack by ourselves
  - We can focus on the aspect of the stack that is most valuable to us. 
  - We don't have to manage the underlying physical infrastructure. 
  - We don't have to manage the resource virtualization hypervisor. 
  - We can build a virtualized infrastructure and can deploy your workloads in this new infra. 
  - We can also buy fully managed services, where you care only about your workloads, handing off the operational burden of managing runtime environments.

| Resources | On-Premise | Private Hosting | Public Cloud
|-|-|-|-|
| Physical security and safety | You | Service Provider | Service Provider|
| Power and network cabling | You | Service Provider | Service Provider |
| Hardware (incl. maintenance) | You | Depends on service provider | Service Provider |
| Virtualization platform | You | You | Service Provider |
| App resources | You | You | You (eventually leveraging fully managed services) |

- Define your starting and target envs
- After that, we define the workload types and the related operational processes that are in scope for the migration. 
- Two types of workloads and operations
  - Legacy
    - Developed without any consideration for cloud environments. 
    - These workloads and operations can be difficult to modify and expensive to run and maintain
    - They usually don't support any type of scalability.
  - cloud-native
    - Natively scalable, portable, available, and secure. 
    - The workloads and operations can help increase developer productivity and agility, 
    - Developers can focus on the actual workloads, rather than spending effort to manage development and runtime environments, or dealing with manual and cumbersome deployment processes
    - Google Cloud is responsible for the physical security and the security of the infrastructure, while you're responsible for the security of the workloads you deploy to the infrastructure (shared responsibility model)

- Some situations:
  - On-premises or private hosting environment with legacy workloads and operations.
  - On-premises or private hosting environment with cloud-native workloads and operations.
  - Public cloud or private hosting environment with legacy workloads and operations.
  - Public cloud or private hosting environment with cloud-native workloads and operations.

- Types of migrations
  - Lift and shift
    - We move workloads from a source env to a target env with minor or no modifications or refactoring
    - The modifications you apply are only the minimum changes you need to make in order for the workloads to operate in the target environment
    - Ideal when a workload can operate as-is in the target environment, or when there is little or no business need for change
    - There might be technical issues that force a lift and shift migration.
    - The easiest way to perform because team can continue to use the same set of tools and skills that they were using before.
    - The results are non-cloud-native workloads running in the target environment, because don't take full advantage of cloud platform features, such as horizontal scalability, fine-grained pricing, and highly managed services.
  - Improve and move
    - We modernize the workload while migrating it.
    - We modify the workloads to take advantage of cloud-native capabilities (not just to make them work in the new environment). 
    - We can improve each workload for performance, features, cost, or user experience.
    - If the current architecture or infrastructure of an app isn't supported in the target environment 
    - A major update to the workload is necessary
    - Improve and move migrations take longer than lift and shift migrations, because they must be refactored in order for the app to migrate.
    - An improve and move migration also requires that you learn new skills
  - Remove and replace
    - We decommission an existing app and completely redesign and rewrite it as a cloud-native app
    - If the current app isn't meeting your goals—for example
    - We don't want to maintain it
    - It's too costly to migrate using one of the previously mentioned approaches, 
    - It's not supported on Google Cloud—you can do a remove and replace migration
    - Remove and replace migrations let your app take full advantage of Google Cloud features, such as horizontal scalability, highly managed services, and high availability. 
    - We're rewriting the app from scratch, you also remove the technical debt of the existing, legacy version.
    - Take longer than lift and shift or improve and move migrations.
    - This type of migration isn't suitable for off-the-shelf apps because it requires rewriting the app. 
    - A remove and replace migration also requires new skills.

### Google Cloud Adoption Framework
  - We should evaluate the maturity of your organization in adopting cloud technologies
  - A map for determining where the business information technology capabilities are now, and as a guide to where you want to be.

- Assessment
  - We perform through assessment and discovery of an existing environment in order to:​
    - Understand your app and environment inventory​
    - Identify app dependencies and requirements​
    - Perform total cost of ownership calculations​
    - Establish app performance benchmarks​​
- Plan​
  - We create the basic cloud infrastructure for the workloads to live in and plan how we will move apps, it includes:​
    - Identity management​
    - Organization and project structure​
    - Networking​
    - Sorting the apps​
    - Developing a prioritized migration strategy​
- Deploy​
  - We design, implement and execute a deployment process to move workloads to Google Cloud​
- Optimize​
  - We begin to take full advantage of cloud-native technologies and capabilities to expand the business's potential to things such as performance, scalability, disaster recovery, costs, training, as well as opening the doors to machine learning and artificial intelligence integrations for your app.​

### The objectives of Cloud Plan and Foundations are:
- Set up the Google Cloud foundation.
- Create design documentation.
- Plan deployment and migration activities.
- Deploy workloads into production.
- Track issues and risks.

## Migrate to Google Cloud: Assess and discover your workloads

- We need to gain deep knowledge about the apps you want to migrate, their requirements, their dependencies, and about your current environment.
- In this phase, you perform the following steps:
  - Build a comprehensive inventory of your apps.
  - Catalog your apps according to their properties and dependencies.
  - Train and educate your teams on Google Cloud.
  - Build an experiment and proof of concept on Google Cloud.
  - Calculate the total cost of ownership (TCO) of the target environment.
  - Choose the workloads that you want to migrate first.

### Building an inventory of your apps

- How many items, such as apps and hardware appliances, exist in your current environment, along with their dependencies
- The inventory shouldn't be limited to apps only, but should at least contain the following:
  - Dependencies of each app, such as databases, message brokers, configuration storage systems, and other components.
  - Services supporting your app infrastructure, such as source repositories, continuous integration (CI) tools, and artifact repositories.
  - Servers, either virtual or physical, and runtime environments.
  - Physical appliances, such as network devices, firewalls, and other dedicated hardware.
- When compiling this list, you should also gather information about each item, including:
  - Source code location and if you're able to modify this source code.
  - Deployment method for the workload in a runtime environment, for example, if you use an automated deployment pipeline or a manual one.
  - Network restrictions or security requirements.
  - IP address requirements.
  - How you're exposing the workload to clients.
  - Licensing requirements for any software or hardware.
  - How the workload authenticates against your identity and access management system.
  - For each hardware appliance, you should know its detailed specifications, such as its name, vendor, technologies, and dependencies on other items in your inventory.
